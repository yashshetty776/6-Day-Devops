## 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud Basics

On the first day of training, we were introduced to the **fundamentals of DevOps** and the **importance of cloud computing**. Here's what we learned:

---

## 🚀 What is DevOps?

Our trainer explained that **DevOps** is both a **cultural shift** and a **technical practice** that integrates **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)** teams to deliver software:

- **Faster**
- **More reliably**
- **Collaboratively**

Traditionally, Dev and Ops worked in silos, leading to miscommunication and delays. DevOps solves this by enabling **continuous feedback**, **automation**, and **integration** across the entire software lifecycle.

## 🔁 DevOps Pipeline

We were introduced to the concept of a **DevOps pipeline**, which is an automated process that allows code to move through various stages:

1. **Build**
2. **Test**
3. **Deploy**

Each code change goes through the same consistent flow, reducing human errors and ensuring high-quality delivery.

### 🧰 Tools Commonly Used:
- **Git** – Version control
- **Jenkins / GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipelines
- **Docker** – Containerization
- **Monitoring Tools** – For post-deployment reliability

## ❓ Why is DevOps Needed?

We learned that DevOps solves key issues from the traditional development model by introducing:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
- **Automated Testing & Delivery**
- **Improved Collaboration**

## 💼 4 Key Factors for Business Success (With DevOps)

1. ⚡ Faster Delivery of Services  
2. ✅ High Quality – No compromise on standards  
3. 💸 Lesser Spending – Efficient use of resources  
4. 🌐 High Availability of Services  

These are the reasons why DevOps practices are adopted in modern IT and business environments.

## ☁️ Cloud Computing Basics

To support DevOps practices, we were introduced to the concept of **Cloud Computing**:

- **Cloud** refers to remote services available over the internet.
- **Data Center** is a physical setup where multiple servers are hosted.

### 🧩 Types of Cloud:

- **Public Cloud** – Accessible over the internet (e.g., AWS, Azure)
- **Private Cloud** – Used internally by organizations

### ☁️ Service Models:

- **IaaS** – Infrastructure as a Service  
- **PaaS** – Platform as a Service  
- **SaaS** – Software as a Service

## 🌍 Introduction to AWS

We discussed **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as a leading public cloud provider and its key advantages:

- **Self-service** capabilities
- **High Availability** (up to 99.11%)
- **On-demand services** as needed

### 🧱 AWS Services Covered:

| Category     | Services Explained                     |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Compute**  | EC2 – Deploy applications on cloud     |
| **Containers** | EKS – Elastic Kubernetes Service       |
| **Databases** | DynamoDB (NoSQL), RDS (Relational DB)  |
